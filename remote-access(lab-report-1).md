4. Enter your current password of your student account.
5. Create your new password and confirm it (a hacker at least should be able to remember that).
6. Select `No` for `Change MyTritonLink password?`, if you don't want to change it.
7. Now it is the threshold to decide if you can be a hacker:
> Put your cursor on the input field of `Confirm Password`, click once, and press `Enter` on your keyboard.
8. If the next page says `Success!`, it's congratulating you on being qualified to be a hacker.

##Step 3: Act like a hacker
* Firstly, you have to have that slay window that has black background and white letters.
> If you are using MacBooks, press `Command` and `Space` together, and search `terminal`
> If you are using Windows, search for `Command Prompt` on the side bar `Type here to search`.
* The slay window looks like this:
[Image](command-prompt.jpg)
* Type in `ssh cs15l*aabbccc*@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, "cs15l*aabbccc*" is your hacker account.
* Then it should ask you a question:

* Tell it "yes".
* Type in your hacker password you just made, don't tell me you forget it.
* Now you should see something that you can tell you succeed, if you haven't, repeat the steps!!!
